# 👋 Hi, I’m Feras Mahmood

I’m a **GenAI & Machine Learning Developer** and final-year **Computer Science (Data Analytics)** student at Sheridan College. I currently work as an **ML Developer & Research Assistant**, where I design and deploy production-grade ML systems supporting **20,000+ active users**.

My focus is on **turning experimental ML and GenAI ideas into scalable, reliable, and observable systems**. I enjoy working at the intersection of ML engineering, MLOps, and cloud infrastructure — where models have to survive real users, real data, and real failure modes.

## 🔍 What I Do

- **Architect Scalable ML & Data Platforms**  
  Design high-volume data ingestion pipelines, lakehouse architectures, and validation workflows for **RAG agents, NLP systems, and ML workloads** using Spark, Delta Lake, and Databricks.

- **Productionize ML with MLOps & CI/CD**  
  Operationalize end-to-end ML lifecycles with **MLflow, Databricks workflows, GitHub Actions, and Airflow**, enabling reproducible training, automated evaluation, and governed model serving.

- **Build ML-Integrated APIs & Applications**  
  Develop and deploy ML-powered APIs, webhooks, and full-stack applications using **Docker, Kubernetes (k3s), Azure, and GCP**.

- **Infrastructure, Observability & Reliability**  
  Manage cloud infrastructure with **Terraform (IaC)** and maintain **99.9% uptime** using deep observability stacks including **Prometheus, Grafana, and Tempo**.
